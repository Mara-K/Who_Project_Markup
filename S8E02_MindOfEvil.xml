<action>The Doctor and Jo drive up to the Constable's Gateway entrance to Dover Castle, currently masquerading as HM Prison Stangmoor, and parks on the drawbridge.</action> 
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> It looks like Dracula's castle. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address>'re right about the castle bit. It used to be a fortress in the Middle Ages. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>? <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address>'ll need this. </line>
<action>Jo gives him an ID pass.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Thanks, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>. </line>
<action>The Doctor rings the entrance bell.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Smile, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> What? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <address who="jo" level="pronoun">You</address> on camera. </line>
<action>The Doctor waves at the CCTV, and the personnel in the security room stare at the crazy man on the monitor. A prison officer comes out.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass. </line>
<line><speaker who="guard0">OFFICER</speaker> <action>into R/T</action> Right. Passes checked and satisfactory. Right, open the gates. </line>
<action>The Doctor gets back into Bessie.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Abandon hope all ye who enter here. </line>
<action>They drive through the gates into a courtyard.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Prison cell block</location>

<action>The prisoners are restless, and making lots of noise in their cells which masks some dialogue. A central staircase leads up to a catwalk. By a glass brick wall is a door labelled Process Theatre.</action>
<line><speaker who="powers">POWERS</speaker> <address who="green" level="surname">Green</address>! Calm the men down. <reference who="govnr" level="title">The Governor</reference>'s on his way. </line>
<action>Green goes up the stairs.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Morning, <address who="powers" level="title">Chief</address>. Everything all right? </line>
<line><speaker who="powers">POWERS</speaker> Will be, <address who="govnr" level="sir">sir</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Good, good. Well, let's see to it. </line>
<line><speaker who="guard0">OFFICER</speaker> <location>OC</location> Keep that noise down!</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Cell block landing</location>

<action>The Governor, Powers, Kettering and Summers, in a white lab coat, go up the stairs and are let through a gate to another corridor leading to steps downwards.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Why do they always have to make that stupid row?</line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> It always happens when sentences are being carried out.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Prison cell</location>

<action>Two guards are with the prisoner, who leaps up when the party enters.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> <address who="barnham" level="fullName">George Patrick Barnham</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> No, <address who="govnr" level="pronoun">you</address>'re not going to take me anywhere! </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> <address who="barnham" level="pronoun">You</address> have been sentenced by a court of law. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> Get away from me! </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> The time has come for that sentence to be carried out. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> Go on! Get out! All of you! </line>
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> I'll give <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">him</reference> something to calm <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">him</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> <address who="summers0" level="pronoun">You</address> won't give me nothing, <address who="summers0" level="otherEndear">mate</address>. Get out, all of you! </line>
    <line><speaker who="powers">POWERS</speaker> Pack it in, <address who="barnham" level="surname">Barnham</address>. <address who="barnham" level="pronoun">You</address>'re just being stupid. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> You're not going to get me out there! </line>
    <line><speaker who="powers">POWERS</speaker> Get <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">him</reference>! </line>
<action>The two guards grab Barnham.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> All right. </line>
<line><speaker who="guard1">GUARD</speaker> You come easy. </line>
<line><speaker who="barnham">BARNHAM</speaker> Take it easy, <address who="guard1" level="pronoun">you</address>'ll break me arm. </line>
<action>Protesting loudly, Barnham is manhandled up the short staircase.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Process Theatre</location>

<action>It is not just Jo and the Doctor who are gathered to observe something. There is a whole gaggle of men with clipboards sitting around.</action> 
<line><speaker who="green">GREEN</speaker> Sorry about the noise, ladies and gentlemen. Just a temporary disturbance. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Temporary disturbance? It sounds like a full-scale riot. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Morbid lot of sensation seekers. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Then why did you insist on coming here? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Scientific curiosity, <address who="jo" level="myDear">my dear</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Oh, yes. </line>
<action>Everyone sits down.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever since I first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up. </line>
<action>The Governor, Kettering and Powers enter.</action> 
<line><speaker who="powers">POWERS</speaker> Keep them quiet. </line>
<line><speaker who="green">GREEN</speaker> All right, chief. </line>
<action>Green leaves.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Good morning. </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> May I introduce <reference who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Professor Kettering</reference>, who will explain the process you're about to see demonstrated. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Well, as you're no doubt aware, we no longer execute our hardened criminals and killers. Modern society has progressed far beyond that primitive form of retribution. Today, science </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <action>sotto</action> It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted this infallible method. <reference who="master" level="aliasFull">Professor Emil Keller</reference> </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <action>sotto</action> People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground, I think. </line>
    <line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> For the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my audience, I will explain in very simple terms. <reference who="master" level="aliasFull">Professor Emil Keller</reference>, the inventor of this process, discovered that anti-social behaviour was governed by certain negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the Keller machine, extracts these impulses and leaves a rational, well-balanced individual. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> It doesn't. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> What? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> May I be permitted to continue? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, yes. Yes, please do. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Thank you. The condemned man is placed here <action>in a chair</action> after being tranquillised, with his head under this dome. A series of probes are attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural circuits. The extraction process is controlled here. The negative impulses are stored in that reservoir box there. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Where do they go after that? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Nowhere, sir. I repeat, they are stored in the box. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at this time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland. A hundred and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we shall witness the one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, <address who="summers0" level="titleSurname">Doctor Summers</address>. </line>
<action>Barnham is wheeled in on a gurney, drugged and in an operating gown.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Come on, <address who="barnham" level="otherEndear">old chap</address>. Up <address who="barnham" level="pronoun">you</address> get. </line>
<action>Barnham is helped into the chair and a metal cap fastened to his head.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> When the process is completed, the negative impulses that made <reference who="barnham" level="thatNP">this man</reference> a criminal will have been removed. <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">He</reference> will take his place as a useful, if lowly, member of society. Are you ready, <address who="summers0" level="titleSurname">Doctor Summers</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yes. </line>
<action>Kettering adjusts the machine that holds the reservoir box then goes to the main control panel and flicks switches. He nods to the Governor.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Let the sentence of the Court been carried out. </line>
<action>The lights go down, leaving Barnham in a spotlight. The machine starts pulsing. Barnham screams.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I knew there was something evil about that machine. </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> <address who="ketter" level="surname">Kettering</address>! Look at the dial. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> What of it? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> It's never registered so high before. </line>
<action>Summers checks Barnham for a heart beat.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Mister Kettering</address>, what's happening? </line>
<action>Kettering turns off the machine and the lights come back up.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Well? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> A minor malfunction. The machine compensated. The process is completed satisfactorily. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <action>sotto</action> Satisfactorily be blowed. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> <reference who="barnham" level="theNP">The subject</reference> will be taken away to recuperate and within an hour or two <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">he</reference> will be perfectly normal. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I admire your confidence, <address who="ketter" level="sir">sir</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Thank you. That is all, gentlemen. </line>
<action>As the observers leave, the Doctor goes over to the Governor and Kettering.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> I take it everything was all right, <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Mister Kettering</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Yes, of course, <address who="govnr" level="title">Governor</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Then would you kindly explain, <address who="ketter" level="sir">sir</address>, <reference who="barnham" level="thatNP">that unfortunate man</reference>'s reaction? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> An excess of negative particles. The machine overreacted. </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> In other words, <address who="ketter" level="pronoun">you</address> don't know. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> May I ask who <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> are, <address who="doctor" level="sir">sir</address>? </line>
    <line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> <reference who="doctor" level="title">The Doctor</reference> is Scientific Advisor to UNIT, <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Mister Kettering</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> UNIT? </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> How interesting, though I fail to see what concern it is </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> UNIT, <address who="ketter" level="sir">sir</address>, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to mankind. And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>.</line>

<action>Barnham is alive but unconscious.</action> 
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Right. </line>
<action>Kettering enters.</action> 
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Well? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Nothing much wrong physically. Respiration normal, pulse rate's a little high but that's usual after the process. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Ah, exactly. A completely successful treatment. </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> The reaction was unusually violent. </line>
    <line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Really, <address who="summers0" level="myDearNP">my dear Summers</address>, <address who="summers0" level="pronoun">you</address>'re as bad as <reference who="doctor" level="thatNP">that interfering fool from UNIT</reference>. </line>

<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Anything the matter? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> There's been some kind of an accident in the process room. They think <reference who="linwd" level="theNP">the man</reference>'s dead.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Process Theatre</location>

<action>A young man is lying on the floor. Green checks his wallet as Summers and the orderlies enter.</action> 
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> What happened? </line>
<line><speaker who="green">GREEN</speaker> I don't know, <address who="summers0" level="sir">sir</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> What happened? </line>
    <line><speaker who="green">GREEN</speaker> I don't know, <address who="govnr" level="sir">sir</address>. I was coming along the corridor and I heard <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">him</reference> screaming. </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Is <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">he</reference> dead? </line>
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yes, <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">he</reference>'s dead. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Probably a heart attack. Delayed shock from seeing the process. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem. </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yes. Yes, a good idea. I'll see to it right away. Get a stretcher, will you? </line>
<action>Summers leaves.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Doctor? Did you see his face? <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">He</reference> looks terrified. And those marks, like </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Bites and scratches? Yes, I know. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Look, I think we'd better get on to <reference who="brig" level="title">the Brigadier</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes, I agree, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post mortem first. It'll give me more to go on. </line>
    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> All right. Anyway, I don't think <reference who="brig" level="pronoun">he</reference>'d thank us for disturbing <reference who="brig" level="pronoun">him</reference> right now. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Hmm? </line>
    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <reference who="brig" level="pronoun">He</reference> did tell <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> all about it, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> All about what? </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Today's the first ever World Peace Conference. UNIT's handling all the security arrangements.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Brigadier's office</location>

<action>This time he has managed to requisition a very posh room with big double doors, fancy fireplace and large potted ficus.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> <action>on phone</action> Yes, that's all very well, <address who="minist0" level="sir">sir</address>, but in my opinion. </line>
<action>Yates enters.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Yes, I see, <address who="minist0" level="sir">sir</address>. Of course, <address who="minist0" level="sir">sir</address>. I take it that is your final decision? Very well, <address who="minist0" level="sir">sir</address>, goodbye. </line>
    <line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Trouble, <address who="brig" level="sir">sir</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> That was <reference who="minist0" level="title">the Ministry</reference>. UNIT'll be responsible for the safe transport of the missile. It's been cleared with <reference who="geneva" level="title">Geneva</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on our hands as well. </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Yes. I want <address who="yates" level="pronoun">you</address> to take charge of this escort detail, <address who="yates" level="titleSurname">Captain Yates</address>. I've got quite enough on my plate as it is. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> I'll get onto it right away. </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Oh, is <reference who="doctor" level="title">the Doctor</reference> back from Stangmoor yet? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> No sir. Er, what exactly is <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">he</reference> doing down there? </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Observing new development in the treatment of criminals, I believe. Oh well, I suppose it'll keep <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">him</reference> out of mischief. By the way, how are things at the conference? </line>
    <line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Oh, all running smoothly, <address who="brig" level="sir">sir</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> I only hope it lasts. </line>
<action>A Chinese woman officer bursts in, followed by a female UNIT officer - Bell.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> All right, <address who="cplbell" level="titleSurname">Corporal Bell</address>. Yes, <address who="jinli" level="fullName">Captain Chin Lee</address>, what can I do for <address who="jinli" level="pronoun">you</address>? </line>
    <line><speaker who="jinli">CHIN LEE</speaker> <address who="brig" level="title">Brigadier</address>, an outrage has been committed against the Chinese people's delegation. As <address who="brig" level="pronoun">you</address> are in charge of security arrangements, we hold <address who="brig" level="pronoun">you</address> directly responsible.</line> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> What is it now, <address who="jinli" level="title">Captain</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="jinli">CHIN LEE</speaker> Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng Teik's suite.</line> 
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> That's impossible. There's a twenty four hour guard on all the delegates' suites. </line>
<line><speaker who="jinli">CHIN LEE</speaker> Nevertheless, the theft has occurred. Your guards are inefficient. Perhaps they take bribes? </line>
    <line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> That is an insulting suggestion, <address who="jinli" level="title">Captain</address>. I will not tolerate any! Very well, <address who="jinli" level="title">Captain</address>, I'll investigate the matter immediately. </line>
<line><speaker who="jinli">CHIN LEE</speaker> I must warn you that this puts the success of the peace conference in grave jeopardy. We suspect the imperialist Americans of this crime. </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Naturally. I assure <address who="jinli" level="pronoun">you</address> that every effort will be made to locate the missing papers and to punish whoever is responsible. </line>
<line><speaker who="jinli">CHIN LEE</speaker> Any further trouble and our delegation will withdraw from this conference.</line>
<action>Chin Lee leaves.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> More trouble. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Mmm, pity. <reference who="jinli" level="pronoun">She</reference>'s quite a dolly. </line>
<action>Chin Lee leaves 24 Cornwall Gardens and walks straight past the limousine waiting for her. She goes to the Green in middle of the area and takes a document from her jacket. She removes it's ribbon and sets fire to it then drops it into a waste paper basket at the last moment. Then she flinches and touches a round metal device just behind her right ear before leaving the scene.</action>

<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> And <address who="ketter" level="pronoun">you</address> are still convinced this Keller process is working normally? </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Yes, of course it is. I mean, <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>'ve just seen <reference who="barnham" level="surname">Barnham</reference>. </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes. Yes, I've seen <reference who="barnham" level="pronoun">him</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Look, <reference who="master" level="aliasFull">Emil Keller</reference> himself installed it here. I worked closely with <reference who="master" level="pronoun">him</reference>. I know every facet of the process. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes, I know. But I still don't like it. </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> What? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Interfering with the mind, <address who="govnr" level="title">Governor</address>. It's a dangerous business. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Well, it's hardly your concern, is it? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Professor Kettering</address>, it is everyone's concern! </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> <location>OC</location>After <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address>.</line> 
<action>Jo and Summers enter.</action> 
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> Ah, <address who="summers0" level="titleSurname">Doctor Summers</address>. Any news for us? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> I've got the post mortem report. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker>Well? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> The deceased's name was <reference who="linwd" level="fullName">Arthur Linwood</reference>, a medical student in his final year. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes, yes, yes, but what did <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">he</reference> die of? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Heart failure. </line>
    <line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Watching the process was too much for <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">him</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> But he didn't have a weak heart, <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Mister Kettering</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Anything in his medical history? </line>
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yes, I called his hospital. <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">He</reference> suffered from a fear of certain animals. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, which ones? </line>
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Well, apparently, in the laboratory <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">he</reference> was absolutely terrified of </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Rats? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yes. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these bites and scratches, could they have been caused by rats? </line>
<line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Certainly they could, yes. </line>
<line><speaker who="govnr">GOVERNOR</speaker> But there are no rats in this room. There's none in the entire prison. </line>
    <line><speaker who="summers0">SUMMERS</speaker> Yet all the indications are that <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">he</reference> was attacked by a horde of them, and the shock killed <reference who="linwd" level="pronoun">him</reference>. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address> must be mistaken. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> But <reference who="linwd" level="surname">Linwood</reference> is dead. </line>
<line><speaker who="ketter">KETTERING</speaker> Because of heart failure! </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> No, <address who="ketter" level="titleSurname">Professor Kettering</address>, because of this machine. </line>

<action>As the machine sits in the process theatre across the hallway, its reservoir full of black thoughts, the Doctor is fixing up a large coil of cable.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Look, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> must hurry! If that thing in there starts moving again </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, thank you. Right. Excuse me, will you? </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Oh. </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Would <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> mind bringing that plug with <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address>, please? </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Oh, right. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> And the coil. </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Yeah. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Thank you.</line>

<scene><location>Prison cell block</location>

<action>They go to a trolley with a large battery-like box on it. There is a slider and several switches on it.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Look, tell me, what precisely do <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> intend to do? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I'm going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there. If I can get close enough to it without being killed, that is. </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> I see. Well, what can I do to help? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, I want <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> to operate these controls here and switch on to full power when I call out. </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> This is very ingenious. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain. </line>
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> And <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> think that'll deal with it? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I don't know, but I think it'll confuse the creature enough to take away its power of movement anyway. </line>
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Well, I hope <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> are right. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> So do I. </line>
<action>The Master plugs the cable into the box, while the Doctor puts on protective clothing.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Now switch it on now, will you? Bottom one. </line>
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Right. Well, good luck to <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>. </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Thank you. Right, <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> know what to do. </line>

<action>The Doctor kicks open the doors and sidles in carefully. As he gets close, the machine starts up and the coil that the Doctor is holding begins to spit sparks. The nightmare images return as the Doctor struggles to get the coil close to the machine.</action>
