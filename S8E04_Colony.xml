                had time carefully to consider the statements that have been put before me. On the
                one hand, while I have every sympathy with the aspirations of the colonists, there
                can be little doubt that their stay here is not proving a success. On the other
                hand, we have this planet, rich in duralinium, a mineral that is much needed on
                Earth. I therefore have no alternative but to rule that colonisation on this planet
                is unsuitable and the settlers will leave here as soon as possible.</line>
