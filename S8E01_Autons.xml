            <action>A little man in a bowler hat watches the customers enter the big top of the
                International Circus. He walks round the back, past the lion's cage and finds a
                quiet spot to light up a small cigar. We hear the sound of the Tardis materialising
                and a motor horse box suddenly appears in the open ground before him. Agog, the man
                walks over and looks round it while a trim man in black suit and gloves, and with a
                neat beard gets out.</action>

            <action>Rossini goes to grab the Master, but it is his wrist that is taken in a
                vice-like grip. Rossini is forced to his knees and their eyes meet. After a few
                moments the Master lets Rossini go and walks a few steps, then snaps his fingers.
                Rossini gets up and follows.</action>

                sonic screwdriver. Philips arrives in the main control room as the Master brings a
                UNIT ammo box into telescope control and takes out the Nestene energy unit. He plugs
                it into a control panel then reorients the radio telescopes.</action>
