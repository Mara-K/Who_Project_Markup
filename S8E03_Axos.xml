<action>An elegant golden spaceship is picked up on a tracking dish.</action> 
<line><speaker who="radar1">RADAR 1</speaker> Twenty five mps. One million miles. Mass, variable. </line>
<line><speaker who="radar2">RADAR 2</speaker> Well, if that's its course, we've discovered a comet. Run another course check. </line>
    <line><speaker who="radar1">RADAR 1</speaker> It's altered its course! </line>
    <line><speaker who="radar2">RADAR 2</speaker> It can't have. </line>
    <line><speaker who="radar1">RADAR 1</speaker> Oh, yes it can, <address who="radar2" level="otherEndear">mate</address>. <address who="radar2" level="pronoun">You</address> can say goodbye to your comet, 'because whatever that thing is, it's on collision course and heading straight for Earth. </line>
<action>We get a close up at the approaching ship, with it's organic-looking hull, leech-mouth-like bow, and tail-shaped stern. Inside, large lifeforms with lots of root-like appendages flail around.</action>

    <line><speaker who="chinn">CHINN</speaker> Typical! Absolutely typical! That's the kind of high-handed attitude one's come to expect from the UN recently. Now, <address who="brig" level="title">Brigadier</address>, what about <reference who="doctor" level="thatNP">this Doctor</reference>? I gather <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">he</reference>'s not a British subject.

<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, gentlemen, there's your enemy. </line>
<line><speaker who="axonm">AXON MAN</speaker> Our worlds are uncountable light years away on the far rim of the galaxy. Our planetary system has been crippled by extreme solar flare activity.

<line><speaker who="axonm">AXON MAN</speaker> Axonite is, shall we say, the chameleon of the elements. It is a thinking molecule. It uses the energy it absorbs, not only to copy but to recreate and restructure any given substance.</line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> And yet <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address> still ran out of fuel? </line>

<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> And this brings in the whole output of Reactor One? </line>
<line><speaker who="winser">WINSER</speaker> Yeah! The particles are accelerated round and round the cyclotron in an ever increasing electromagnetic field. Eventually, we hope to have controlled acceleration up to the speed of light. Now, once beyond that point, the particles will be travelling in the fourth dimension.

Now what I propose to do is this. Stack up as much power as the Tardis will take, then channel it back through the accelerator and boost it, so that instead of the gradual power build-up that <reference who="axos" level="title">Axos</reference> expects, it'll get the whole lot in one devastating surge. </line>
<line><speaker who="hardiman">HARDIMAN</speaker> What else can we do? </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Oh, nothing very much. Oh, I suppose you can take the normal precautions against nuclear blast, like, er, sticky tape on the windows and that sort of thing. </line>

<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, what are those figures? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, they're just some course coordinates, that's all. </line>
    <line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> What do <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> want course coordinates for, <address who="doctor" level="nickname">Doc</address>? <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address>'re not thinking of leaving us, are <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>? </line>
<action>The Doctor gives the printout to the Master at the Tardis' door.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Here <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> are. Everything ready? </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Just the check. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Good. Yes, as a matter of fact, we are. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> Not if I can help it! </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Drop that, <address who="filer" level="surname">Filer</address>! </line>
    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>! <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>! </line>
<action>The Doctor shoots Filer with the laser gun, low voltage so he just drops the pistol.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Sorry, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>. Ah, <address who="brig" level="title">Brigadier</address>, just in time to say goodbye! </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> No, you can't! </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I'm sorry, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>, we must. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> We? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes. After all, we are both Time Lords. Goodbye, <address who="brig" level="title">Brigadier</address>, <address who="chinn" level="titleSurname">Mister Chinn</address>. Goodbye, <address who="filer" level="nickname">Bill</address>. Goodbye, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>. I shall miss you. </line>

    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Very neat, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>. You know, I must say I never thought that <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>'d go through with it. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> If we're going, let's go. </line>
<action>But the Tardis won't start. The Doctor puts the circuit back where he took it from and tries again. This time the rotor starts to go up and down.</action>

<scene><location>Light Acceleration laboratory</location>

    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> No, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> can't! Please! <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>! </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> This is it. We're being over-run. </line>
<action>The Tardis dematerialises.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Get the men inside! Get that blast door locked! </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> Come on, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>! </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Take positions back from the door! </line>
<action>To the sound of weapons fire outside, UNIT troops rush in and everyone takes cover either behind the control console or the accelerator chamber.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Tardis</location>

<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> But <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> can't rematerialise yet! We're not even in space time! </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> This is as far as we're going for the moment. </line>
<action>The Tardis materialises.</action> 
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> But where are we? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address>'ll recognise it when <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> see it. Right, outside. Come on, out!</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Axos main chamber</location>

<action>The blue Tardis is parked opposite a plain white one.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> But <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> must be mad! Why have <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> brought us here? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> want your Tardis back, don't you? We can't beat <reference who="axos" level="title">Axos</reference>. We may as well join <reference who="axos" level="pronoun">it</reference>. </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> Why have you returned? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> That's simple. Because <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address> are winning. And we have a proposition. <address who="axos" level="pronoun">You</address> may have conquered this tiny speck in space but <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address>'ve yet to conquer time. </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> Well? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> We are prepared to give <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address> this power on one condition. That we join forces against the High Council of the Time Lords. </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> How can we do this? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> By linking our drive systems. In this way, <reference who="axos" level="title">Axos</reference> will become a Tardis and the Tardis will become a part of <reference who="axos" level="title">Axos</reference>. </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> And you? </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> No. My part is finished. All I'm interested in is the return of my Tardis. Well, I will leave you to your new alliance. </line>
<action>The Master is prevented from reaching his Tardis by a forcefield.</action> 
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> I insist on my freedom! </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> When the link is complete, then <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> can have your freedom.</line>

<action>Something is burning through the blast door.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Grenades. Wait for it. Wait for it. </line>
<action>Then everything goes quiet.</action> 
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> What's happened, <address who="filer" level="nickname">Bill</address>? Why has it suddenly stopped? </line>
<line><speaker who="chinn">CHINN</speaker> Don't you think we ought to negotiate? </line>
<action>Blue energy surges through the hole in the door to the accelerator chamber.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> What happened? </line>
<line><speaker who="tech2">TECHNICIAN</speaker> They've energised the light accelerator. Good grief! </line>
<action>The dial is moving up to light x 4.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Well, is there anything we can do? </line>
<line><speaker who="tech2">TECHNICIAN</speaker> Not without the trigger mechanism. The particles will just go on and on accelerating. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> Then what? </line>
<line><speaker who="tech2">TECHNICIAN</speaker> Bang. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> The blast wall, <address who="brig" level="sir">sir</address>! </line>
<action>The hole is now man-sized.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Tardis</location>

<action>The Doctor is connecting an Axon tendril to the console.</action> 
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Tell me, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, isn't that a rather primitive way to make a link? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Look, will <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> stop pestering me! </line>
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> All right. I'll check the course circuits. </line>
<action>The monitor shows a dot moving in a figure of eight.</action> 
<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address>'ve got it set in a time loop! </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> That's right, yes. </line>
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> Attention! Attention! Nutrition cycle incomplete. Disconnect all systems.</line>

<scene><location>Axos main chamber</location>

    <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Stop <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">him</reference>! Don't <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address> understand? <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">He</reference>'s committing suicide and <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">he</reference>'s taking us all with <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">him</reference>! <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">He</reference>'s doing this for Earth, not for <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address>. <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">He</reference>'s putting you all in a time loop and <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address>'ll never get out of it! Never! </line>
<action>The Master enters his own Tardis.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Tardis</location>

    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Come on! Come on, <address who="axos" level="pronoun">you</address> must take the load! <address who="axos" level="pronoun">You</address> must! </line>
<action>The Axon creatures burst into the lab. Benton and Yates roll grenades at them, but to no effect. The UNIT soldiers start firing, then Jo screams. One soldier is pushed over the railing, another zapped by a tendril. The whole situation looks hopeless, then the spaceship dematerialises, taking the creatures with it. The Doctor is held against the console by them instead.</action> 
    <line><speaker who="axos">AXOS</speaker> <location>OC</location> Your sacrifice was in vain, <address who="doctor" level="aliasTitle">Time Lord</address>. <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address> are joined to us forever in this loop of time. Our fate is yours. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Not if I can break through this time loop! </line>
<action>The Doctor inches his hand to a control and activates it. The Tardis materialises in space.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Light Acceleration laboratory</location>

<line><speaker who="tech2">TECHNICIAN</speaker> Light accelerator's still building! It's going to go! </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Right, everybody outside! Evacuate the whole area. Go on! </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="filer" level="nickname">Bill</address>! </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Go on! Come on! </line>
<action>Everybody leaves, then the Tardis materialises in the lab. Outside, the Brigadier drives Jo and Chinn away in Chinn's limousine while UNIT get into their Land Rover and drive off. The Doctor enters the lab to see the dial at light x 5 and climbing. The ceiling starts to come down so he gets back into the Tardis.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Dungeness</location>

<action>The vehicles park up and everyone gets out to see what will happen to the complex.</action> 
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> Get down! </line>
    <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> What about <reference who="doctor" level="title">the Doctor</reference>? Supposing <reference who="doctor" level="pronoun">he</reference> comes back? </line>
<action>The Doctor gets the Tardis started again. The research laboratory goes Boom! but the genuine nuclear power station is untouched, thank goodness. The group drive back.</action>
</scene>
<scene><location>Nuton complex</location>

<action>The Brigadier and Jo are staring at the pile of twisted metal girders when the Tardis materialises.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well! This is a fine welcome, I must say!</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Nuton Complex office</location>

<action>The blast has blown the wall away but the potted plant looks healthy enough.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, it's perfectly simple, <address who="brig" level="title">Brigadier</address>. A time loop is, er. Well, it's a time loop. One passes continually through the same points in time. Passes through the same. Yes. Well, the Axons said they wanted time travel and now they've got it. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> What about <reference who="master" level="title">the Master</reference>? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, I sincerely hope <reference who="master" level="pronoun">he</reference>'s with them. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> Hope? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, I can't be absolutely sure. I was pretty busy at the time. But I'm ninety percent certain though. </line>
<line><speaker who="filer">FILER</speaker> How much? </line>
    <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, pretty certain. Well, I suppose <reference who="master" level="pronoun">he</reference> could have got away. Just. </line>
<line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> This time loop thing. How did <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> get out of it? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I simply boosted the circuits and broke free. </line>
    <line><speaker who="brig">BRIGADIER</speaker> And <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> came back of your own accord? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, I </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> No. No, I'm afraid not. No, obviously the Time Lords have programmed the Tardis always to return to Earth. It seems that I'm some kind of a galactic yo-yo!</line>
