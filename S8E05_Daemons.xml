<scene><location>Village Green</location>

<action>It is a dark and stormy night. The quiet village of Aldbourne in Wiltshire pretends to be Devil's End, with an appropriate eerie howling wind and thunderstorm. Lightning briefly the church illuminates the over the green as the public house, the Cloven Hoof, turns out its last customers, a man and his dog into the storm.</action>

  <line><speaker who="frank">FRANK</speaker> <location>OC</location> Goodnight, <address who="jim" level="nickname">Jim</address>. </line>
<action>By the churchyard, the dog gets free of his master and runs through the gravestones, barking. Jim follows, and we hear a strange noise as a look of terror comes over his face.</action>

<scene><location>Street</location>

<action>Next morning is dry and clear. The local eccentric spinster is walking along with the local doctor.</action> 
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> <reference who="jim" level="pronoun">He</reference> died of fright, <address who="reeves" level="title">Doctor</address>. </line>

  <line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I don't care what <address who="reeves" level="pronoun">you</address> say. <reference who="jim" level="theNP">The man</reference> died of fright! </line>
  <line><speaker who="reeves">REEVES</speaker> <address who="olive" level="myDearNP">My dear Miss Hawthorne</address>, the medical diagnosis was quite clear. <reference who="jim" level="pronoun">He</reference> died of a heart attack. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> But his face? </line>
<line><speaker who="reeves">REEVES</speaker> Slight protrusion of the eyeballs, rictus drawing of the lips back over the teeth. Common enough in heart failure. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> The signs are there for all to see! I cast the runes only this morning. </line>
<line><speaker who="reeves">REEVES</speaker> <address who="olive" level="pronoun">You</address>'ll have to excuse me. I have my rounds to do. </line>

  <line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> If <reference who="horner" level="titleSurname">Professor Horner</reference> opens up that barrow, <reference who="horner" level="pronoun">he</reference> will bring disaster on us all! </line>

<action>The Doctor is working on Bessie's engine.</action> 
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> But it really is the dawning of the age of Aquarius. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> So? </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Well, that means the occult. Well, you know, the supernatural and all that magic bit. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> You know, really, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>, I'm obviously wasting my time trying to turn <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address> into a scientist. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Well, how do <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> know there's nothing in it? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> How? Well, I just know, that's all. Everything that happens in life must have a scientific explanation. If you know where to look for it, that is. Excuse me. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Yes, but suppose something was to happen and nobody knew the explanation. Well, nobody in the world, in the universe. Well, that would be magic, wouldn't it? </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> You know, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>, for a reasonably intelligent young lady, <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address> do have the most absurd ideas. </line>
<action>Bessie starts up and drives off.</action> 
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Doctor, look! </line>
<action>Bessie goes for an independent spin around the yard before driving back into the garage.</action> 
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <address who="bessie" level="nickname">Bessie</address>, how dare <address who="bessie" level="pronoun">you</address> go gallivanting around like that. </line>
<action>Parp.</action> 
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Are <address who="bessie" level="pronoun">you</address> sorry? </line>
<action>Parp, parp, honks Bessie.</action> 
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Very well, I forgive <address who="bessie" level="pronoun">you</address>. Now go back to your parking place before I change my mind. </line>
<action>Bessie reverses out of the garage.</action> 
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> I know there's a good explanation for all this, but I just can't think of it for the moment. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Would you believe magic? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Magic? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Hmm. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> No! </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address> would. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> That's not fair. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address> explain it then. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> I don't know. I suppose <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> did it. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Naturally. Or should I say scientifically. Solenoids and a solar mechanism in <reference who="bessie" level="nickname">Bessie</reference> and </line>
<action>The Doctor takes a hand-sized box out of his overall pocket.</action> 
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> A radio control unit here. You see how easy it is to be a magician? </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> How infuriating can <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> get. Well, it doesn't prove anything. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Would you like me to show <address who="jo" level="pronoun">you</address> some more then? </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> No thanks, I've had enough of your knavish tricks. Anyway, I want to see that TV programme. <address who="yates" level="nickname">Mike</address>, would you give me a lift? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Sure. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Thanks. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> You coming, <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Coming where? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Well, to see that programme. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, not <address who="yates" level="pronoun">you</address> too, <address who="yates" level="titleSurname">Captain Yates</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Very exciting. Forecasts of doom and disaster if anyone disturbs the burial chamber. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <address who="yates" level="titleSurname">Captain Yates</address>, <address who="yates" level="pronoun">you</address> astound me. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Well, you never know. Devil's End has a funny reputation. </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> What did <address who="yates" level="pronoun">you</address> say? </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Devil's End. The village near the dig. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Devil's End? Devil's End? </line>
  <line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, are <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> all right? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Yes. Yes, I'm fine.</line>

<scene><location>Church cavern</location>

<action>The broadcast is getting underway, and Time Team it ain't. Alastair Fergus is speaking direct to camera, his voice echoing eerily in the dark undercroft.</action> 
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Devil's End. The very name sends a shiver up the spine. The witches of Devil's End, the famous curse, the notorious cavern underneath the church where the third Lord of Aldbourne played at his eighteen century parody of black magic. Devil's End is part of the dark mythology of our childhood days. And now, for the first time, the cameras of the BBC have been allowed inside the cavern itself. In this cavern, pagan man performed his unspeakable rites. In this cavern, the witches of the seventeenth century hid from the fires of Matthew Hopkins, witch-hunter extraordinary. In this cavern. But I could go on all day. </line>
<action>Fergus goes past a tableau of devil worship to a cross-legged gargoyle, its chin resting on its hands.</action> 
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> There is something strange about Devil's End. Is <reference who="horner" level="titleSurname">Professor Horner</reference> being as foolish as his critics would suggest? I must admit, standing here in this unquiet place, I'm beginning to wonder myself.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Barrow</location>

<line><speaker who="harry">HARRY</speaker> Quiet please! </line>
<action>And cues Fergus, standing outside the tunnel entrance.</action> 
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> While I was recording that earlier this afternoon, the archaeological dig was proceeding apace. <reference who="horner" level="titleSurname">Professor Horner</reference> and his team have cut their way into the Devil's Hump, as this barrow is called by the locals, as if it were a giant pie. But now the question is, can <reference who="horner" level="titleSurname">Professor Horner</reference> pull out his plum? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Get on with it, <address who="fergus" level="man">man</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Or will <reference who="horner" level="title">the Professor</reference> be proved disastrously wrong?</line>

<action>Bunk beds, table, telephone, drinks machine, a television. Benton is watching TV.</action> 
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location>For some two hundred years, the controversy has raged. What is the Devil's Hump. Now, we're not the first to try and find out. But from 1793, when Sir Percival Flint's miners ran back to Cornwall leaving him for dead to the famous Cambridge University fiasco of 1939</line>
  <action>Jo, the Doctor and Yates enter.</action> 
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Has it started yet? </line>
<line><speaker who="benton">BENTON</speaker> Shush. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Let's see what <reference who="fergus" level="pronoun">he</reference> has to say. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Has remained an enigma. But tonight, the enigma will be solved.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Barrow</location>

<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Tonight, at midnight, the witching hour, viewers of BBC3 will have the privilege of being present when <reference who="horner" level="fullName">Professor Gilbert Horner</reference>, the noted archeologist </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Got round to me at last, have you? About time too. </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Not yet, <address who="horner" level="title">Professor</address>, not yet. </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Hey <address who="anon" level="pronoun">you</address>, bring that camera over here, would you? Come on!</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>Barrow entrance</location>

<action>Horner leads Fergus and the cameraman down the tunnel to a large stone blocking their way.</action> 
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> There, that's the spot. Six inches behind there lies the greatest archaeological find this country has known since Sutton Hoo. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Would <address who="horner" level="pronoun">you</address> like to explain that reference, <address who="horner" level="title">Professor</address>? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> No. And at midnight tonight </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Sutton Hoo, of course </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Never mind about Sutton Hoo. This is what your precious viewers are interested in. The Devil's Hump and what's inside it, right? </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> And what is inside it? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Treasure, that's what. The tomb of a great warrior chieftain, bronze age, 800 BC. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <address who="horner" level="pronoun">You</address>'re very precise? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> No need to take my word for it. See for yourself, midnight. </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Ah yes, now then, why midnight and why tonight? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Well, it's obvious. April 30th is Beltane, isn't it? </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Beltane? </line>
  <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> You know, <address who="fergus" level="pronoun">you</address> ought to have done your homework before <address who="fergus" level="pronoun">you</address> came on this dig. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> For the viewers, <address who="horner" level="title">Professor</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> April the 30th, Beltane, greatest occult festival of the year, bar Halloween.</line>
</scene>
<scene><location>UNIT HQ room</location>

  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Well, frankly, I'm not much wiser. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Beltane. Of course. </line>
  <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> <location>on TV</location> <address who="fergus" level="pronoun">You</address>'ve heard the tales about this place? The ghosts, the witches, the curse. The famous curse. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> <address who="horner" level="pronoun">You</address> don't believe that. </line>
  <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Do <address who="fergus" level="pronoun">you</address>? </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Well then, why have <address who="horner" level="pronoun">you</address>? </line>
        <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> <location>on TV</location> My new book comes out tomorrow. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Oh. Then it's what one might call a publicity gimmick. </line>
  <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> <location>on TV</location> Top of the class, <address who="fergus" level="other">lad</address>. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> And <address who="horner" level="pronoun">you</address>'re not concerned about the reaction of your colleagues to </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> You know, there's something dreadfully wrong here. </line>
<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Hey, <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> really mean that, don't you? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> <location>on TV</location>Oh, they'll react the same way as always. They'll turn green. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Well, what could be wrong? </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <location>on TV</location> But surely, if <address who="horner" level="pronoun">you</address> </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> I don't know. Aquarius? The Devil's Hump? Beltane? </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> <location>on TV</location> I know perfectly well you're on the air. That's why I'm here. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Come on, think, think! </line>
  <line><speaker who="benton">BENTON</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="title">Doctor</address>, look. Something's going on. </line>
<action>The broadcast has moved back outside the barrow to fend off Miss Hawthorne and her umbrella.</action>

  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Okay, <address who="harry" level="firstName">Harry</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I've come here to protest, and protest I shall. </line>
<line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Now this is <reference who="olive" level="titleSurname">Miss Hawthorne</reference>, a prominent local resident who's very much opposed to Professor Horner's dig. <address who="horner" level="titleSurname">Professor Horner</address>, I believe you two have already met? </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> I'll say. <reference who="olive" level="theNP">The daft woman</reference>'s been pestering me for weeks. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I've been trying to make <address who="horner" level="pronoun">you</address> see reason. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <address who="olive" level="titleSurname">Miss Hawthorne</address>, why are <address who="olive" level="pronoun">you</address> so opposed to this dig? </line>
  <line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> Because <reference who="horner" level="thatNP">this man</reference> is tampering with forces <reference who="horner" level="pronoun">he</reference> does not understand. </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> Oh, come on now. </line>
  <line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> <address who="horner" level="pronoun">You</address>'ll bring destruction on yourself and upon the whole area if you persist. Death and disaster await you. Believe me, I know. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> But that's just it. Why should we believe <address who="olive" level="pronoun">you</address> and how do <address who="olive" level="pronoun">you</address> know? </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I'm a witch. </line>
  <line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> You see? I told you <reference who="olive" level="pronoun">she</reference> was daft. </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> <address who="olive" level="titleSurname">Miss Hawthorne</address>, <address who="olive" level="pronoun">you</address> don't really mean to say </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I tell you I'm a witch! White, of course, but that is why you should listen to me. I know! </line>
  <line><speaker who="fergus">FERGUS</speaker> Well, thank you very much, <address who="olive" level="titleSurname">Miss Hawthorne</address>, for a most interesting </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> I've cast the runes. I've consulted the talisman of Mercury. It's written in the stars. When Beltane is come, tread softly, for lo, the prince himself is nigh. And tonight is Beltane. </line>
<line><speaker who="horner">HORNER</speaker> You see? Mad as a hatter. </line>

<line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Now, <address who="winstanley" level="pronoun">you</address>'d better explain to them all why you've called them together, then leave the rest to me. </line>
  <line><speaker who="winstanley">WINSTANLEY</speaker> Yes. Meeting to order, please. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Well now, it seemed to me that we ought to get together and discuss the situation, before it gets out of hand. Now it seems that <reference who="master" level="theNP">the vicar here</reference> has had a few thoughts on the subject, so I've asked <reference who="master" level="pronoun">him</reference> to put in a word. <address who="master" level="aliasFull">Mister Magister</address>.</line>

<line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> A spaceship, fifteen inches long? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> That's right. Mind you, when it landed it was two hundred feet long and thirty feet across. But they diminished it, just as they diminished themselves, which accounts for the heat wave and the freeze-up. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Hmm? Sorry, could <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> say that again? I didn't quite follow <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Oh, come on, <address who="jo" level="nickname">Jo</address>. E=MC squared. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">You</address>'re the Doctor. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Look, when you lose mass the energy has to go somewhere. </line>
<line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> I see, so all we've got to deal with is something which is either too small to see or thirty feet tall, can incinerate you or freeze you to death, turns stone images into homicidal monsters and looks like the very devil. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Exactly. </line>
<line><speaker who="benton">BENTON</speaker> Well, I still don't get it. I mean, what's the creature doing here? I mean, why did they ever come? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> To help Homo sapiens kick out Neanderthal man. They've been coming and going ever since. The Greek civilisation, the Renaissance, the industrial revolution. They were all inspired by the Daemons. </line>
  <line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> But this thing <reference who="horner" level="title">the Professor</reference> let loose is evil, <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> said so yourself and now <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address>'re trying to say they've been helping mankind for a hundred thousand years. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> Yes, and <address who="doctor" level="pronoun">you</address> say they come from another planet. Well then, what's all this jazz about witchcraft and covens and so on? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Look, don't you see? All the magical traditions are just remnants of their advanced science, and that is what <reference who="master" level="title">the Master</reference> is using. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> Then these creatures are linked with the black arts. They are evil. </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Amoral, perhaps. They help Earth but on their own terms. It's a scientific experiment to them. Just another laboratory rat. </line>
  <line><speaker who="yates">YATES</speaker> Then what's <reference who="master" level="title">the Master</reference> up to? </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> <reference who="master" level="pronoun">He</reference>'s established a link with <reference who="azal" level="theNP">the Daemon</reference>. What worries me is the choice. Domination by <reference who="master" level="title">the Master</reference> or total annihilation. </line>
  <line><speaker who="jo">JO</speaker> What, <reference who="azal" level="thatNP">this Daemon</reference> could destroy the world? </line>
<line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> What does any scientist do with an experiment that fails? He chucks it in the rubbish bin. </line>

  <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Now, as I've told you, this is not going to be a sermon. But all the same, I do beg of you to listen carefully. Because this could be the most important day in your lives. Now as you know, I am a newcomer among you, and yet already I feel that I know you all. For instance, <address who="thorpe" level="pronoun">you</address>, <address who="thorpe" level="titleSurname">Mister Thorpe</address>.

<line><speaker who="thorpe">THORPE</speaker> What are <address who="master" level="pronoun">you</address> on about? That's slander. </line>
  <line><speaker who="master">MASTER</speaker> Now, now, don't deny it. I know. And you, <address who="charlie2" level="nickname">Charlie</address>. How's your conscience? Do <address who="charlie2" level="pronoun">you</address> think <address who="charlie2" level="pronoun">you</address>'ll manage to balance the Post Office books in time? And <address who="grenville" level="pronoun">you</address>, <address who="grenville" level="titleSurname">Mister Grenville</address>. Has your wife come back from her sisters yet? Will she ever come back, do <address who="grenville" level="pronoun">you</address> suppose? Now, now, no, please. Please do not be angry with me. I assure you that I'm on your side. Now, listen. If you do what I say, you can all of you get whatever you want in this world, when you want it. If you listen to me.</line>

<line><speaker who="thorpe">THORPE</speaker> How? </line>
  <line><speaker who="doctor">DOCTOR</speaker> Well, the emotions of a group of ordinary human beings generate a tremendous charge of psychokinetic energy. This <reference who="master" level="title">The Master</reference> channels for his own purpose. </line>
<line><speaker who="olive">HAWTHORNE</speaker> But that is magic. That's precisely what black magic is. </line>
